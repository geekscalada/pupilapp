Eventsource has close() method.

When you use close(), stream variable don´t will be cleared, but, you don´t receive any events asociated to this stream.

Do you need close addEventListeners to make garbage collector to reach this event and clear it for us? IDK
    - It seems the response is not. 
    - program closes when all of the streams are closed. 




Evensource has a value of state of the connection, where:

  0 — connecting
  1 — open
  2 — closed
